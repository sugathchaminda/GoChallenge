If check with the invalid URL it gives the error as below
{
    "error": true,
    "message": "Url is not valid",
    "data": null
}

This is the correct response that I got from the postman.
localhost:8002/numbers?u=localhost:8090/primes&u=localhost:8090/fibo

result is  - 
{
    "Numbers": [
        1,
        2,
        3,
        5,
        7,
        8,
        11,
        13,
        21
    ]
}


Confilct in the following - 
If only one url return error or too long to respond, what is need to be done.
However I have given the result of one Url also.

ex - say prime url too long to respond, but fibo gives the result, then it will print the 
	result of fibo end point.


Few unit tests have written in the manager_test.go, numberHandler_test.go files. (see the manager folder and handler folder inside the folder structure.)

##I have not added the binary file here. Please generate it.
